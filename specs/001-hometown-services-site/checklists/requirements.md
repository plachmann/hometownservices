## Validation Notes

**Passed All Checks**

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. Key observations:

1. **User Stories**: 5 prioritized user stories covering browse, search, contact, service area, and admin management
2. **Functional Requirements**: 19 requirements covering public website, admin functionality, and content requirements
3. **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
4. **Scope**: Clear in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries defined
5. **Technical Constraints**: Deployment requirements captured separately from implementation details

The spec avoids implementation details while capturing all stakeholder requirements from the original description.

## Status

**READY FOR NEXT PHASE** - Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
